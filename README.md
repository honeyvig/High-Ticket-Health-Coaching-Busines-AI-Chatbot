# Helper function to interact with OpenAI
def ask_openai(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Helper function to add a contact to GHL
def add_contact_to_ghl(name, email, phone):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {GHL_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "name": name,
        "email": email,
        "phone": phone,
        "tags": ["Free Community"]
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{GHL_API_URL}/contacts/", headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()

# Helper function to book a call in GHL
def book_call(contact_id, calendar_id, time_slot):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {GHL_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "contactId": contact_id,
        "calendarId": calendar_id,
        "startTime": time_slot
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{GHL_API_URL}/appointments/", headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()

# Chatbot Route
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json.get("message", "")
    context = request.json.get("context", "")

    # Generate response using OpenAI
    ai_response = ask_openai(f"{context}\nUser: {user_message}\nChatbot:")

    # Logic to handle specific tasks
    if "join community" in user_message.lower():
        ai_response += "\nPlease provide your name, email, and phone number to join."
    elif "book call" in user_message.lower():
        ai_response += "\nWhen would you like to schedule your call? (Provide date and time)"

    return jsonify({"response": ai_response})

# Add Contact to GHL Route
@app.route("/add_contact", methods=["POST"])
def add_contact():
    name = request.json.get("name")
    email = request.json.get("email")
    phone = request.json.get("phone")

    response = add_contact_to_ghl(name, email, phone)
    return jsonify(response)

# Book Call Route
@app.route("/book_call", methods=["POST"])
def book():
    contact_id = request.json.get("contact_id")
    calendar_id = request.json.get("calendar_id")
    time_slot = request.json.get("time_slot")

    response = book_call(contact_id, calendar_id, time_slot)
    return jsonify(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Features

    Chatbot Functionality:
        Engages users with dynamic responses via OpenAI GPT.
        Guides users to join the community and book calls.

    Integration with GHL:
        Adds users to the CRM as contacts with relevant tags.
        Books onboarding calls using GHL's calendar integration.

    Customizable Prompts:
        OpenAI prompts can be tailored to the brand's tone and personality.

Usage

    Run the Flask App:

    python chatbot.py

    Chat API Endpoint:
        POST requests to /chat with user messages and context.

    Add Contact Endpoint:
        POST requests to /add_contact with name, email, and phone.

    Book Call Endpoint:
        POST requests to /book_call with contact_id, calendar_id, and time_slot.

Next Steps

    Frontend Integration:
        Build a web interface or integrate with messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger).

    Testing:
        Validate functionality by simulating user interactions and checking GHL updates.

    Deployment:
        Host the chatbot on AWS, Heroku, or similar platforms for accessibility.

This chatbot can efficiently engage prospects, guide them to join the community, and schedule onboarding calls, helping to drive conversions and enhance the user experience.

The secondary goal is to get the prospect to book an onboarding call for the free community with one of our community success managers.

We use GoHighLevel (GHL) but the chatbot does not need to exclusively leverage the native chatbot tools within GHL.

You will have worked with high-ticket courses and GHL and can showcase relevant examples of your work.

Please provide a rough estimate based on the above.
